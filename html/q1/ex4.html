<h2>What does water mean to the world?</h2>
<h4>On 22 March 2021</h4>
<h5> the world marked World Water Day, with the theme for this year’s celebration being “valuing water.” What can the long history of water’s connection with health teach us about its true value to the world?</h5>
<h6>Pure water is usually described as tasteless and odorless, although humans have specific sensors that can feel the presence of water in their mouths,[84][85] and frogs are known to be able to smell it.[86] However, water from ordinary sources (including mineral water) usually has many dissolved substances that may give it varying tastes and odors. Humans and other animals have developed senses that enable them to evaluate the potability of water in order
 to avoid water that is too salty or putrid.</h6>
