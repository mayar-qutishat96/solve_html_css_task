<h5><U>What is the introduction of math ?</U></h5>
<h6>mathematics is the <mark>science and study of quality ,
structure,space,and change.</mark>mathematics seek out
patterns,formulate new conjectures,and establish truth by rigorous
deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions.
</h6>
<p>there is debate over whether mathematicals objects 
sush as numbers and points exist naturally or are humens creations.
the mathematician <strong>benjamin peirce </strong> called mathematics 
<q><u> the science that draws necessary conclusions .</u></q>
<mark>Albert Einstein</mark> on the other hand , stated that
<q><u>as far as the lows of mathematics refers to 
reality ,they are not certain : and as far as they are certain 
. they do not refer to reality.</u></q>
<P><U>today,mathematics is used throughout the world as an 
 essential tool in many fields,including natural science ,engineering,
 and the social science .</U> applied mathematics ,the 
branch of mathematics concerned with application of 
<strong>mathematical knowledge </strong> to other fields.inspires and 
and makes use of new mathematical discoveries and sometimes
leads to the development of entirely new disciplines.
mathematicians also engage in pure mathematics,or mathematics
for its own sake, without having any application in mind,
although practical application for whats began as pure 
mathematics are often discovered later.

<h5><U>Introduction to chamistry  ?</U></h5>
<P><mark>chamistry</mark> is the study of matter and the ways 
 in which diffrent forms of matter combine with each other.
 <u>you study chamistry becouse it helps you to understand
 the world around you.</u> everything you touch ot taste or smell
 is a cemical,and the interactionsof these chemical
 with each other define our universe.
 <mark>chemistry forms the fundamentel basic for biology and 
medicine.</mark> from the structure of proteins and nucleic
acids,to the design,synthesis and manufacture of drugs ,chamistry allow you <br>   
 </P>
<p><del>the principles of chemicals are quite varied
 and are essentially impotant which includes brain functioning
 computer operations,weather patterns ,chemical industries ,
 manufacturing fertilizers ,acids,alkalis, salts,drugs,soaps,etc.
 </del>chemistry also acts as a major determinant in meeting 
 the humen needs for food,healthcare products,and also other
 <mark>materials</mark>are aimed at improving the lifes quality.
